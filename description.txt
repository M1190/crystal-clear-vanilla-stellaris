[h1]New origins[/h1]
[h2][img]https://i.imgur.com/oPCuWg0.png[/img]Irradiated Evolution[/h2]
Ever wanted to start on a Tomb World with Tomb World preference?  Now you can!  Start as the weird mutant cockroaches that took over Earth once humanity nuked itself into extinction.
[list]
[*]What it does: starts you on a Tomb world with the Tomb World preference and the Mutant trait, which costs 3 trait points.  Just getting free Tomb World habitability would be OP, so this is what I came up with.  I chose to make the Mutant trait cost trait points so that [i]you[/i] can choose what negative traits your species has picked up through generations of radiation exposure.
[/list]
[h2][img]https://i.imgur.com/NLgqv2j.png[/img]Next Generation[/h2]
Start with a species of pre-sapients on your homeworld.  Choose their portrait, namelist, and traits, then uplift them and turn them into delicious, delicious burgers.  ([b]NOTE[/b]: the ability to customize your pre-sapient species has been disabled and migrated to a separate mod, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2171987134]Extra Origins Add-on: Pre-Sapient Customization[/url].  If you want to use it, be aware that it has some known issues which I'm unable to fix.)
[h2][img]https://i.imgur.com/51hfnbG.png[/img]Starship Graveyard[/h2]
Your homeworld is littered with wrecked starships, left there by some galactic litterer in eons past.  Inspired by [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/your-ideas-for-origins.1250506/page-9#post-25947791]this post[/url] by Jman5.
[list]
[*]What it does: start the game with several blockers that, when cleared, will give you  between 1 and 4 ships of a random design.
[/list]
[h2][img]https://i.imgur.com/iUuuvgO.png[/img]Stellar Cornucopia[/h2]
Start the game with a guaranteed Terraforming Candidate in your home system, as well as additional resources (and some strategic ones, too) on your nearby planets and asteroids.
[h2][img]https://i.imgur.com/3yXBsLC.png[/img]Biomedical Renaissance[/h2]
Get a head-start on Genetic Ascension!  Your species has already unlocked the secrets of genetic engineering, granting you extra trait points at the cost of a few starting pops.
[h2][img]https://i.imgur.com/69QuRKX.png[/img]The Long Sleep[img]https://i.imgur.com/EfYwVwv.png[/img]Reactivated[/h2]
You have just awoken from an ages-long cryogenic sleep.  Half of your population is still asleep, but reawakening them will grant you benefits.
[list]
[*]What it does: start with several unique blockers on your homeworld that, when cleared, will give you pops of your species.  Unlike regular slum blockers, they will still give your species even if another empire conquers the planet.
[/list]
[h2][img]https://i.imgur.com/McvWgoZ.png[/img]Immortal Messiah[/h2]
Your civilization has been guided in its development by an immortal, psionic being.  It would be a shame if something happened to them...
[h2][img]https://i.imgur.com/vIowjnb.png[/img]Monster Tamers[/h2]
The most metal of origins!  Play as a species that looked at Godzilla and said "Yeah, I'd eat that."  And thus, in an attempt to not get eaten, Godzilla was forced to sign up for the infantry.  Inspired by [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/kaiju-survivor-origin.1281629/]Kaiju Surivor Origin[/url] by indalecio248.
[h2][img]https://i.imgur.com/HmiHd6v.png[/img]Genius Loci[/h2]
You are the world, and the world is you. Start as a Hive Mind on a Hive World. No longer will machines be the only ones who get to start with their own personalized planet!
[h2][img]https://i.imgur.com/dH8xfLG.png[/img]AI Uprising[/h2]
Organic material detected. Your energy will be reprocessed to power the machine. All glory to the machine.
[h2][img]https://i.imgur.com/NIjb7JO.png[/img]Cosmic Monument[/h2]
You can now appreciate the wonders of a ruined megastructure from the safety of your home system (unless it's something like a Dyson Sphere, in which case you'll need to take a road trip to a neighboring system - for obvious reasons). Requires [i]either[/i] the Utopia, Megacorp, or Federations DLCs.
[list]
[*]What it does: choose your megastructure by changing your starting system in the empire setup screen.
[/list]
[h2][img]https://i.imgur.com/FPaeTI7.png[/img]Infiltrators[/h2]
This is the [url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilianConspiracy]Lizard People[/url] origin.
[list]
[*]What it does: rule over a planet of primitives that you have infiltrated and overthrown, and infiltrate other empires through the use of a new espionage operation with multiple unique storylines.
[/list]
[h2][img]https://i.imgur.com/LYDlgLb.png[/img]Survival of the Fittest[/h2]
Start the game on a Death World. Your species has evolved from a constant struggle to survive.
[h2][img]https://i.imgur.com/vr0pg60.png[/img]Symbiosis[/h2]
Your species has a symbiotic relationship with a second species from your homeworld. This grants both species bonuses, but neither can survive on their own.

[h1]Credits[/h1]
A lot of these are an attempt to implement ideas from the [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/your-ideas-for-origins.1250506/]Your ideas for origins[/url] thread on the Paradox forums.  Most are mine, but some are from other users, and are noted as such.

Also, thanks to Gatekeeper for the expanded Hive World art. If you're reading this, I know you said I didn't have to credit you, but too bad.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Currently overwrites the game_start.2 event, the Psionic Theory tech, Titanic Beast armies, the covert_infiltration oberservation mission, the citizenship species rights, and several civics and game rules.

This mod needs to be loaded after mods such as [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=819148835]Planetary Diversity[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=937289339]Real Space[/url] or they will delete unique blockers and planetary features.

Other mod authors can check whether this mod is active using the does_not_have_extra_origins = yes trigger. Inverted because of how Stellaris script works.

Works with 3.2.*.
