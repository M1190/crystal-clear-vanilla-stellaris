Major governments overlooked their own selfish interests to strike a Grand Accord, agreeing to move a critical portion of their populations to jointly administered orbital habitats while their combined militaries remained planetside to wage a scorched earth campaign against the pandemic. This bold move succeeded, proving T'pheric civilization cannot easily be uprooted."
