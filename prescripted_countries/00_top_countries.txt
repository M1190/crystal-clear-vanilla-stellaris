Brutal conflicts with the Chinese and Indian empires over spheres of influence cost many lives, but did little to forestall the Roman Emperors' dominance of their  homeworld. By the industrial age, however, the power of the mercantile elector class within Rome's upper echelons grew to outstrip that of the Senate and even the Emperor himself. These old imperial institutions still exist in the Interstellar Age, but as mere figureheads. Deeply embedded within Terran science, industry, and finance, the Church holds the true reins of power. While the Emperor remains head of state, the highest ecclesiastic leader in Terran society, the Supreme Pontif, is its de facto ruler.

A small population of genetically superior lab-grown ('decanted') humans, calling themselves Mirandans, assumed leadership of the colony. Meanwhile, a rapidly reproducing population of genetically labotomized subhuman laborers, called Calibans, were tasked with the hard and dangerous frontier duties of colonial expansion. This experiment enabled the extremely rapid settlement of Miranda and a return to spaceflight within a century of their arrival, but its long-term societal costs can only be guessed at.

Various Medieval Islamic powers expanded to fill the vacuum, first colonizing Europe and then discovering the Americas. Invigorated by a new era of frontiersmanship, these societies birthed a Renaissance spanning from Qurtuba to Makka to Jayakarta. During Earth's Industrial and Machine Ages, the Dar al-Islam came into frequent conflict with the Indian Travancore League and Chinese Empire. The struggle between these three blocs culminated in the Long War, spanning decades and killing hundreds of millions. Such horrific bloodshed gave rise to the political philosophy of Moral Progressivism. Dominated by the victorious powers of Firanja, Jinshan, and the Japanese Republic, the Human homeworld thrived under a syncretic vision of Islam, Buddhism, democracy, and environmentalism. As Humanity expanded into space, an enlightened and unified global government emerged to ensure lasting peace and prosperity: the Sacred Commonwealth of Earth."

Secretly, the British and Russian Empires exploited the wreckage of second Visitor, discovered crashed in Siberia, to rapidly advance their aerospace technologies. The personal union of Britain and Russia precipitated war with Germany and Austria. The resulting Continental War of 1939 firmy secured Russo-British hegemony over Earth. In time, great statesmen crafted the Terra Carta, the founding document of an imperial federation to govern all Humanity.

The UN Charter amendment of 2061 created the UN Parliamentary Assembly and Protectorate Council, followed in subsequent years by numerous other structural changes. The old Westphalian system was at last fatally undermined by the rise of this world government backed by the military might of emerging superpowers, Brazil and India. Continued administrative integration eventually led to the asymmetric federalization of all UN member states by 2150. In this scheme, off-world colonies are administered by various types of devolved governments under the oversight of the Protectorate until they can qualify for federal incorporation. Reliable FTL travel via hyperlanes and the prospect of interstellar colonization laid the foundation for the UN to evolve yet further into the United Systems Republic, a responsible representative government advancing the interests of Humanity on the galactic stage."
