 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_UPLIFT: "It seems as though they have always been with us, the Elders.

Only recently, though, have we learned what they are shaping us for.\n\nFrom early on they have explained that our kind shows great promise and that their intention was guide us onto a path that would help us reach our full potential. And guide us they did. With their advice, we made great technological strides, quickly mastering electricity, then atomic power, and then crude spaceflight. Under the tutelage of the Elders, we have constructed our first hyperdrives. Now they have invited us to join them as junior partners in their galactic ambitions."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_SUBLIGHT_COMMON_TEXT: "It has been over a hundred years since the first great colonization rush swelled and and subsided, and ironically, those first pioneers in their sub-lightspeed ships took so long to reach their destinations that we back home have lapped them. Scarcely sooner than they'd established their intended colonies, we arrived on craft fitted with newly devloped FTL drives to establish a much closer relationship with the colonies than any of the colonists had anticipated.\n\nIn that time, the world unification just beginning when the colonists departed has been perfected, although at the cost of decades of inward-facing politics and development priorities to bring all the peoples of our homeworld on board.

 ### Capitalistic

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_libertarian_freehold: "Libertarian Freehold"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_libertarian_freehold_desc: "This government is the result of an extreme experiment in privatization where all functions of government were contracted out to various businesses. Only the legislature and courts remain as government entities, with the highest judge in the empire having assumed certain executive powers by default."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_CHIEF_JUSTICE: "Chief Arbitrator"
 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_CHIEF_JUSTICE_FEMALE: "$LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_CHIEF_JUSTICE$"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_LIBERTARIAN_FREEHOLD: "In the early days, our people were governed by huge, inefficient states. We stagnated under their bloated bureaucracies. Then an innovation in statecraft took hold: we let more nimble and efficient businesses start doing the government's work. Now our planetary government mostly serves to set the standards for private contractors and to see justice done when anyone's rights are violated."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_ANARCHO_CAPITALISM: "In the early days, our people were imprisoned and extorted by states. We groaned under the violent demands of kings and bureaucrats. Slowly, freedom-lovers realized that businesses, charities, and civil associations could do everything a state could without coercion. The revolution saw states swept aside and replaced with a variety of voluntary, competitive dispute resolution organizations and covenant communities. Only one vestigial position of government remains to provide a light moderating force."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_corporate_neofuedalism: "Corporate Neofeudalism"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_corporate_neofuedalism_desc: "This government didn't merely contract out its functions to businesses, it is the result of decentralizing government to regional or local scale and running states as businesses, under the forward-thinking guidance of a new aristocracy of wealth.

Only with time did we learn the virtue of inequality and the power of innovative disruption. The ultimate disruption in the realm of a politics beholden to inept corporate interests was to cut the government down to size, and then to cut out the middlemen and run governments like businesses, with our best and brightest entrepreneurs at the helm."

The top became too heavy to be held up, though, and eventually nimble and hungry private enterprises became more influential and powerful than any state by virtue of their innovations. Today, a council of entrepreneurs acts as global referees for business practices to ensure that the freedom to innovate neither overwhelms customers and employees nor crowds out competition."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_MERCH_COMMON: "This society sees commercial success and overall social merit as inextricably linked."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_PHILANTHROPY_DIRECTOR: "Philanthropy Director"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_UTOPIAN_SOCIALISM: "For far too long, the world groaned under the reign of greed and pride, an irrational system of people preying on each other like beasts. But eventually, through the work of modern moral philosophers dedicated to building a more rational world of cooperation where all may prosper, this changed. We now live according to the Great Philanthropic Plan for universal love and moral improvement. Never will [GetSpeciesName] prey on [GetSpeciesName] again!"

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_social_imperialism: "Imperial Socialism"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_social_imperialism_desc: "This socialist dictatorship maintains stability by the widespread distribution of goods and services... underwritten by imperial avarice. With an expansionistic policy that shows little regard for concepts of self-determination and equality, those who fall beneath the hegemony of this state in the name of interplanetary revolution are aptly called 'captive nations.'"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_SOCIAL_IMPERIALISM: "After ages of slaving for bloody kings and greedy merchants, the people finally rose up in revolution. Workers' parties have captured the governments of the majority of nations and put them to the task of social development. The International system on [Capital.GetName] worked well at empowering the vanguard nation of the revolution to free the world with solidarity contributions from its associate workers' states."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_onestate_socialism_desc: "This society has committed itself to constructing socialism in one state, and has renounced the ideal of interplanetary revolution beyond indirect support. Though ready to defend itself against any aggressor, this society directs all its efforts towards the task of socialist construction within its own borders so as to be an inspiration to revolutionaries elsewhere."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_NATIONAL_PARTY_CHAIR: "National Party Chair"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_ONESTATE_SOCIALISM: "After ages of slaving for bloody kings and greedy merchants, the people finally rose up in revolution.

This model inspired other revolutionaries around the world without the need for foreign entanglements or wars."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_workers_republic: "Worker's Republic"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_workers_republic_desc: "This is a republican system of government where the working class and their elected leaders are predominant. Though similar in structure to most republics, the most influential political blocs are the labor unions and cooperative industry lobbies."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_PLEBIAN_TRIBUNE: "Plebian Tribune"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_WORKERS_REPUBLIC: "In the early days, our people were ruled by robber baron bosses and the states that enforced their wills. Gradually, people realized their common interests, and formed industrial unions and new cooperative enterprises. These have become the major conduits of popular power in society. Practically speaking, it isn't feasible to even run for office without the backing of a labor or cooperative federation."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_rustic_republic: "Rustic Republic"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_rustic_republic_desc: "Though some urban centers do exist, the vast majority of the population live and work in the countryside. As a result, when a republican system was adopted, the peasant population so completely outvoted every other class that only those politicians who espouse an agrarian agenda had any chance of success. Permanently preoccupied with matters of rural policy, the governemnt of this society has neither time nor political capital to spare on reckless empire building."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_COUNTRY_CHANCELLOR: "Country Chancellor"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_RUSTIC_REPUBLIC: "Since time immemorial, the vast majority of our people have lived and worked in the countrysides. When they realized their common interests and instituted governments by and for the people, it was the rural people who spoke with the loudest voice. Practically speaking, it isn't feasible to even run for office without the backing of the farms and small towns."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_peasant_commune_collective: "Rural Commune Collective"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_peasant_commune_collective_desc: "This society is a federation of largely self-reliant farming communes, run by elected village councils who delegate their authority to a central government that handles foreign policy and coordinates responses to disasters. It is a fundamentally peaceful society with little interest in conquest."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_COMMUNAL_REPRESENTATIVE: "Communal Representative"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_PEASANT_COMMUNE_COLLECTIVE: "The vast majority of our people have always dwelled in the countrysides and have known the exploitation of absentee landlords, bankers, nobles, and merchants living high on the hog in the cities, sending them to fight and die in wars to enrich the already too-wealthy. With time they came to realize their common interests, and formed agricultural unions and cooperatively owned land trusts, wresting power for themelves and bringing the predation of the cities to an end. Networks of small and sparse communities united by these institutions run the world peacefully to this day."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_peasant_dictatorship: "Peasant Dictatorship"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_peasant_dictatorship_desc: "When a revolutionary party organized the peasantry against their oppressors - landlords, foreign imperialists, and urban capitalists - they enacted a program of radical agrarian collectivism. The result is a ruthless dictatorship where city dwellers and intellectuals are routinely forced to leave the cities and join the peasants in the countryside to learn humility and equality. The party draws its base of support from the peasantry and its governing priorities reflect agrarian needs."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_COLLECTIVE_DIRECTOR: "Collective Director"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_PEASANT_DICTATORSHIP: "The vast majority of our people have always dwelled in the countrysides and have known the exploitation of absentee landlords, bankers, and merchants living high on the hog in the cities, many the puppets of foreign empires who laid waste to the farmlands in bloody wars of conquest. Revolutionary parties of united peasants and workers eventually formed, laid siege to the cities, and wrested power from the exploiters by force. Such a party rules to this day, ensuring that all are taught the great chain of labor from countryside to city that makes the world work and how we all have an equal and tranquil place within it."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_agrarian_monarchy: "Agrarian Monarchy"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_agrarian_monarchy_desc: "The peasants of this world rose up against the landlords and city merchants who exploited them, yet they stilled wished to retain the tradition of the royal family, believing that their sovereigns were benevolent parents misled by evil advisors. Now a single monarch rules over the masses of peasants, the beloved if rather overwhelmed head of a vast family of rural subjects."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_AGRARIAN_MONARCHY: "Since time immemorial, our people have known the cruelty and oppression of the landlords and merchant princes of the cities who corrupted the benevolent monarchs, parents of all the people, with money and bad counsel. When the commoners of the countryside rose up against their urban masters to demand peace and plenty, they effectively freed the royal fathers and mothers of the nations to be the guiding lights they were always meant to be. Supported by a grateful and enthusiastic populace, the chief monarch of the world has become parent to all."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_reactionary_socialism: "Reactionary Socialism"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_reactionary_socialism_desc: "Once, the old elites of this society were threatened by the rise of capitalism. In response, an alliance of the aristocrats and petty-bourgeoise were able to manipulate the emerging working class into siding with them against the new captains of industry. The result is that a restrictive system of state ownership, regulations, tariffs, and taxation to prevent the new self-made bourgeoise from ever threatening to size state power away from old money and old blood."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_LORD_PRESIDENT: "Lord President"
 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_LADY_PRESIDENT: "Lady President"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_REACTIONARY_SOCIALISM: "Since time immemorial, our people have known the cruelty and oppression of merchant princes and guild masters, who grew wealthier the more we toiled for them, sundering all the social bonds which support the world. Fortunately, our wise nobility put a stop to their rapacious designs. Through their generous partnership with the common people and prudent limits on accumulation, the world can still work for working people."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_feudal_socialism: "Feudal Socialism"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_feudal_socialism_desc: "The aristocracy of this society were able to strangle capitalism in its cradle by convincing the workers and peasants that only the noble orders of society could protect them from exploitation. Now the monarch and the court control state-run industries in the same manner as the landed estates of old, passing down mines and manufactories by right of birth. The workers are bound as serfs to their production lines in exchange for the traditional noble obligation of charity, which is much more generous thanks to industrial production methods."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_FEUDAL_SOCIALISM: "Since time immemorial, our people have known the cruelty and oppression of merchant princes and guild masters, who grew wealthier the more we toiled for them, sundering all bonds of obligation and charity. Fortunately, our wise nobility put a stop to their rapacious designs by stepping in to offer the common people protection from need in exchange for loyalty. The traditional patterns of service and hospitality thus continue into the modern era."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_crime_family: "Crime Family"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_crime_family_desc: "Though supposedly nothing more than a family business, its actual operation consists of crime and piracy in all forms. The supreme criminal family controls a number of lesser families as vassals, and whatever vestigial state institutions still exist all answer to the head family's control. The family itself is controlled by a customarily hereditary Boss, who rules even blood relations with an iron fist concealed in a velvet glove."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_BOSSMAN: "Bossman"
 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_BOSSWOMAN: "Bosswoman"
 LRSK_GOV_VAR_HT_HEAD_UNDERBOSS: "Head Underboss"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_CRIME_FAMILY: "Our first governments were weak and ineffective. Crime flourished, and over time the real power came to rest with a powerful criminal enterprise run by a single extended family. Through semi-feudal kinship ties and underworld ritual bonds, it developed into a clandestine business empire of unparalleled might. All rivalling gangs were gradually dealt with one by one. In a final act of consolidation, the officers of the world governments, existing in name only by now, kissed the ring, went on the take, and the chief crime family emerged as the de facto ruling body of our homeworld."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_rogue_freehold: "Rogue Freehold"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_rogue_freehold_desc: "What started out simply as a radical attempt at near total privatization of the economy has turned into something more sinister, as the citizens of the freehold have become increasingly fond of slavery, piracy, and plunder. Since the highest courts have ruled all of those things legal against non-citizens, and since only those who can afford personhood rights insurance can become citizens... there is nothing to stop them indulging from such barbaric pursuits as long as the hated 'statists' are the target."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_HEAD_JUDGE: "Head Judge"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_ROGUE_FREEHOLD: "In the early days, our people were governed by huge, inefficient states. Then an innovation in statecraft took hold: we let more nimble and efficient businesses start doing the government's work. With the boundaries of personal rights now a matter of market negotiation, the best and freest of us are finally able to take what we deserve. Freed of state oppression, when even freedom itself is a commodity, there is no limit to what we may indulge in."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_corporate_banditry: "Corporate Banditry"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_corporate_banditry_desc: "Once a idealistic experiment that sought to establish a market-based stateless society of total liberty, this society has long ago abandoned anything other than power politics cloaked in formal observance the non-aggression principle. Slavery, banditry, murder, and theft - such things are now commonplace, one simply has to be wealthy enough to get away with them. Warlords, armed gangs, and rampant corporations now openly rule over the ruins of what was once supposedly a liberatory project. The most powerful rulers assert their dominance by launching piratical raids against the hated 'statists,' hauling back slaves and treasure to hawk for outrageous prices."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_CHIEFCORPSEC: "Chief of Corporate Security"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_CORPORATE_BANDITRY: "In the early days, our people were imprisoned and extorted by states. Slowly, freedom-lovers realized that businesses,  voluntary societies, and civil associations could do everything a state could without coercion. The only barrier to action became what people were willing to pay or donate towards. Freed of state oppression, when even freedom itself is a commodity, there is no limit to what we may indulge in."

 lrsk_gov_var_chartered.101.desc: "The §Y$lrsk_gov_var_civic_mc_chart_corp_board$§! Civic is designed to emulate historical colonial joint-stock corporations like the British East India Company. Many European nations created companies like this in the early age of exploration and colonization. These nations did not actually have the funds to finance colonial ventures nor the administrative capacity to govern distant lands, so they created these companies as a form of indirect control over extraction: by selling stock in the company, they could raise the initial money (with the promise of a return to the initial investors) while also taxing all the trade between the colonies they created and the mother country.\n\nSince early game Stellaris is set in a new 'age of exploration and colonization,' this seemed like a good fit for a civic with its own playstyle. It puts you in the role of a mixed private/public entity called a §Y$lrsk_gov_var_gov_colonial_charter_board$§!, a kind of public holding corporation that 'charters' colonial companies. The way this works is: when you obtain a vassal, you should eventually be given a choice to turn them into a §Y$preset_lrsk_gov_var_subject_chartered_company$§! vassal. You get §G+2%§! £trade_value£ Trade Value and §G-1%§! Market Fee discount for each $preset_lrsk_gov_var_subject_chartered_company$ under your control. They also inherently like you more as an overlord, so you will have an easier time maintaining control over several of them."
