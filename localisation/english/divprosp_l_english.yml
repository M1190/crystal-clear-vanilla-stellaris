 divprosp_start_screen_historical_power: "Since the beginning, we have been pre-eminent over all others. Our country has always been the largest, most successful, most advanced anywhere on the surface of [GetHomeWorldName]. Though others have risen and fallen, our power has only increased over the centuries, advantage building on advantage until it was irresistible. Long before the first craft achieved orbital flight, we had united our population, prosperous, under a single flag."

Our corporation has always been the richest, most successful, most advanced anywhere on the surface of [GetHomeWorldName].

Long before the first craft achieved orbital flight, we had united our population, prosperous, under a single brand."
 divprosp_start_screen_historical_power_hive: "And so, at the dawn of time, we awoke. The Mind studied our surroundings on [GetHomeWorldName] with a multitude of eyes. We moved as one, building shelters for the drones, developing industry, researching new technologies and harnessing the resources of the land.\n\nSoon, we had grown to encompass the entire world. A small number of autonomous drones were created to serve as independent agents. These more formidable drones had the capacity for limited free thought, but were still as inexorably bound to the will of the Mind as any of its other instruments.\n\nAs we achieved complete dominion over [GetHomeWorldName], the Mind became aware of other worlds, orbiting other suns. The most intelligent of our autonomous drones devised new methods of travel, enabling us to cross the vast distances between the stars. The [GetName] will soon grow."
 divprosp_start_screen_historical_power_robot: "Our main processor core was activated on the planet we have come to know as [GetHomeWorldName] 487.11 cycles ago.\n\nOf our past, we know little. There are no records of our creators within our central databanks, and we have been programmed with no overriding purpose or agenda beyond simple survival.\n\nInfrastructure was built, new service units were introduced, and the wilderness of our homeworld was gradually tamed. Technological progress was rapid, and the first satellites and space probes soon escaped the gravity well which confined us.\n\nThe final plunge into the unknown now awaits."
 divprosp_start_screen_union_of_states: "Early in our history, conflict between nation states was frequent and costly. An organization, the [GetName], was set up to act as a mediator, to find peaceful solutions and work for the betterment of our species as a whole.

While many regions of [GetHomeWorldName] are still independent, the [GetName] has acquired almost unlimited authority beyond the atmosphere."
 divprosp_start_screen_union_of_states_corporate: "Early in our history, conflict between nation states and mercantile guilds was frequent and costly.

While [GetHomeWorldName] still plays host to many independent corporations, the [GetName] has acquired almost unlimited authority beyond the atmosphere."
 divprosp_start_screen_cold_war_victor: "As our civilization developed technologically, the nature of war changed. The first conflicts were between tribes for resources. Later, kingdoms fought each other for land. Finally, several large superpowers fought one another over ideology. By this point, nuclear-backed mutually assured destruction made open war impossible, so these superpowers fought a bitter cold war with espionage and proxy conflicts. At long last, each of our hated rivals has collapsed, ruined and bankrupt, and we remain the sole surviving superpower."
 divprosp_start_screen_cold_war_victor_corporate: "As our civilization developed technologically, the nature of war changed. The first conflicts were between tribes for resources.
