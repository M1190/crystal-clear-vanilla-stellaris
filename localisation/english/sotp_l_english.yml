    EMPIRE_DESIGN_UNSC: "United Nations Space Command"
    EMPIRE_DESIGN_UNSC_desc: "The United Nations Space Command, or UNSC for short, served as the military, exploratory, and scientific agency of the Unified Earth Government. Originally commissioned as a military force the UNSC was once responsible for the overseeing of space battles and the suppression of insurrections.\n\nAs humanity spread through space it was inevitable that other species would be encountered. Now, faced with the potential for extinction, the UNSC has become humanity's primary government and its best hope for survival."

  # The Covenant

    EMPIRE_DESIGN_COV: "The Covenant"
    EMPIRE_DESIGN_COV_desc: "The Covenant, a divine empire spread across the stars, built of many species from many worlds held steadfast by their unwavering belief in their Forerunner gods and the Great Journey; their belief that they too can become divine and ascend to godhood beside the Forerunners.\n\nThe Covenant was formed through war and through war it spreads, consuming or destroying any race they encounter on their quest to acquire hidden knowledge and powerful Forerunner artefacts."
    START_SCREEN_COV: "The Covenant, a divine empire across the stars, built of many species from countless worlds held steadfast by their unwavering belief in their Forerunner gods; hinged on the every word of the High Prophets. The Covenant was formed through war: the San Shyuum and Sangheili races fought valiantly against each other until finally the stalemate was narrowly broken. As peace tithes the writ of union was enacted between their two races, forming the Covenant. Throughout the ages the Elites would be the honourable protectors of the sacred Covenant, crushing rebellions, enlisting and enslaving more species until finally the Covenant became as it is today. The Elites, Grunts, Jackals, Brutes, Hunters, Engineers, Drones and many more became the backbone of the empire, their diversity, and not just their faith, became the Covenant’s true strength.\n\nAs the Covenant spread, more species were incorporated or destroyed and many powerful Forerunner artifacts were unearthed. In one of the many voyages Covenant luminaries discovered troves of Forerunner artifacts on a newfound world. Little did they know the discovery hidden there would bring their entire faith into question, potentially shattering their covenant, it was not they who were chosen by their gods, but Humanity. The Prophets would do anything to preserve their empire, a holy war was declared against the heretics and the Prophets would lead their unknowing followers to victory, to power and the divine beyond."
