 # House Divided Localisation

 origin_mom_house_divided_splinter_colony: "Splinter Colony"
 origin_mom_house_divided_splinter_colony_desc: "This society started out as colonists under their mother nation. Whether it was perceived oppression, political opportunism or simply a strong will to forge its own destiny, this former colony renounced its homeworld's administration and declared independence."
 START_SCREEN_MOM_HOUSE_DIVIDED: "Since the earliest times, our people reached for ever greater goals. We fought wild beasts, tamed the lands, built great cities and spread across our world.\nEventually with the invention of hyperdrive technology we went on to reach for the stars. During our early expansion, small colonies grew to become new homes for our people and a foundation for what was to come. Yet as our eyes lay on the endless sea of the void with worlds just waiting to be claimed, we were betrayed. With our military unprepared for such an event, we could only watch as our colonies declared themselves independent, shattering our plans. We have been in a state of cold war with them ever since. But this madness will end now.\n\nA house divided cannot stand. Unity must be achieved, be it by diplomacy or military force. We will not be denied our destiny!"
 mom_house_divided_system_NAME: "A House Divided"
 mom_house_divided_system_DESC: "An ordinary start in a unary solar system."

 # Severance Localisation

 START_SCREEN_MOM_SEVERANCE: "Our civilization prospered on [GetHomeWorldName] for a long time, but our people always felt that our destiny lay out there in the void. Early space exploration limited to our home system by primitive STL-drives yielded an extraordinary discovery. A wormhole connected our system to another further away than we could ever hope to reach by conventional means. Scouts where sent, followed by a colony ship heading for a planet now known as [event_target:mom_severance_colony.GetName]. It was a dream come true, though as any dream it didn't last.\n\nThe wormhole became unstable shortly after our colony's founding. Experts still debate whether it was ever stable to begin with, or whether we'd just been lucky. Many lives were lost when another wave of colonists failed to reach the other side and further manned travel through it was deemed too dangerous. However, communication is still possible, but supplies sent through it have only a 30% expectancy to reach their destination. This separation left us in a precarious situation.\n\nBut now, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished the development of the first hyperdrives. We are finally able to reach other stars and hopefully our colony as well."
 
 # Breakaway Civilization Localisation (currently unused)

 START_SCREEN_MOM_BREAKAWAY_CIV: "[GetHomeWorldName] is a fractured world, divided between various superpowers. Wars dominated our history, but the splitting of the atom and its derived weapons of mass destruction changed everything.\n\nThough major conflicts have ceased under the threat of mutually assured destruction, we are living in a state of cold war and tensions are higher than ever before.\n\nBut even in these trying times, we have been blessed with good fortune. A discovery has been made in a desolate and sparsely populated area under our dominion - a strange vessel which must have crashed there eons ago. Scientists believe it to be of alien origin and posit that it was once capable of interstellar travel. Thanks to the remote location of this finding, we were able to keep it a secret not only from the broad public but also from our rivals.\n\nToday we will reap the fruits of years of development and research and clandestine operations to establish outposts in our solar system. The [GetName] might not know it yet, but future history books will speak of this day as the beginning of a new age, as we send out our first explorational vessel to another star."

 # Divine Guidance Localisation

 START_SCREEN_MOM_GOD_EMPEROR: "In the distant past, our people fought amongst themselves in a never-ending cycle of violence and retribution. We would still be caught in this madness today, had it not been for [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName].\n\nWhen [ruler.GetSheHe] first revealed [ruler.GetHerselfHimself] to our ancestors, they were nothing more than savages. Yet [ruler.GetHerHis] charisma made them loyal followers of [ruler.GetHerHis] cause. Within a few decades, all [root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] had been united behind the [Root.GetRulerTitle], entering a new age of prosperity and progress under [ruler.GetHerHis] benevolent rule.\n\nToday, on the 2200th anniversary of [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]'s coronation, our civilization will also enter a new age of exploration as our first hyperspace-capable prototype starts its journey to discover distant worlds."

 # Exiles Localisation

 START_SCREEN_MOM_EXILES: "Since ancient times our legends tell the story of a doomed world - ravaged by a merciless foe - and our ancestors, who narrowly escaped their brethren's fate. A long flight from their homeworld in a ragtag fleet of freighters eventually led them to [GetHomeWorldName]. Ill equipped with what little they had left, a colony was founded. Much knowledge and technology was lost in the struggle and hardship of making this planet their new home.\n\nNow, over two millennia later, our civilization has recovered. Great cities have been built, the wilderness tamed, and we are finally ready to return to the stars."

 # Overcrowded Localisation

 START_SCREEN_MOM_CROWDED: "Our civilization has come a long way from fighting off the hazards of our environment and wresting the resources needed to expand from the very ground upon which we stand today. In the ancient times our ancestors could not have imagined that one day [GetHomeWorldName] would cease to satiate the [root.GetSpeciesAdj] hunger for resources and even space to live.\n\nDuring the past decades the problems became ever more obvious to all [root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Cities turned into monstrous travesties of their former self in a failing effort to accommodate the ever increasing number of citizens. With our research focused on finding ways of coping with this situation there appear to be fewer and fewer solutions to be found on [GetHomeWorldName].\n\nEven the supplies provided by various outposts established throughout the solar system won't stall the inevitable collapse for long. The start of our first FTL-capable exploration vessel on its journey to a neighboring star does not happen out of scientific curiostiy or an ill perceived manifest destiny. It is a sheer necessity."

 # Climate Change Localisation (currently unused)
 origin_mom_change_starting_planet_class: "Changed Climate"
 origin_mom_change_starting_planet_class_desc: "Before the invention of the Hyperdrive, disaster struck the homeworld of this species. Weather it be through a meteorite, pollution or natural causes, the climate of this planet has been altered to something the biology of the natives is not equipped to deal with."
 origin_tooltip_mom_change_starting_planet_class_effects: "Homeworld is changed to a different habitable planet class in the same group as the one chosen."

 # Climate Catastrophe Localisation

 START_SCREEN_MOM_DESTROYED_CLIMATE: "Sometime in our past, [GetHomeWorldName] was altered far outside [ROOT.GetSpeciesName] tolerances. Whether by accident, natural causes, or intentional action has been lost in the years following the disaster. Regardless, the event killed billions of our people, those who could not find shelter or endure [GetHomeWorldName]'s changed climate, the countless who died from starvation as crop yields fell, or those slaughtered in the brutal wars over what remained.\n\nIn time, we built domed cities and subterranean catacombs to live in, and eventually we unified beneath a new flag. Now we are ready to reach distant stars, and we will take our knowledge of survival with us."
 START_SCREEN_MOM_DESTROYED_CLIMATE_HIVE: "Sometime in our past, [GetHomeWorldName] was altered far outside [ROOT.GetSpeciesName] tolerances. Whether by accident, natural causes, or intentional action has been lost in the years following the disaster. Regardless, the event killed billions of hive drones, those who could not find shelter or endure [GetHomeWorldName]'s changed climate, the countless who died from starvation as food production fell, or those who slaughtered each other as the wounded hive fought to heal and regain control..\n\nIn time, we built domed cities and subterranean catacombs to live in, and the hive healed until once more we covered [GetHomeWorldName]. Now we are ready to reach the stars, and we will take our knowledge of survival with us."
