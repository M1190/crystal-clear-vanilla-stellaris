 gpm_death_world_desc: "Almost every creature and plant on this world is deadly to sentient life in some way. Life on this world is unimaginably harsh; fifty percent of the planet's population does not survive infancy, and fifty percent of the remainder does not live past the age of ten. Those who do reach adulthood are invariably among the toughest, most uncompromising and resourceful warriors, masters of surviving in one of the most inhospitable environments in the galaxy."
