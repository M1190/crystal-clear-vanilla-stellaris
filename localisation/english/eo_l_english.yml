#Part 3
eo_infiltrators.3.title: "The Abduction"
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_official.desc: "It took some digging, but eventually it came to light that the government offical our spies have been shadowing inside the [target.GetName] is a member of a fringe religous organization. They regularly attend meetings of the cult to engage in questionable rituals. Since they have attempted to keep their membership in the organization a secret, their attendance at one of the rituals could provide just the opportunity we need to abduct and replace them without anyone noticing."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_noble.desc: "The minor noble our spies identified is in possession of a large estate in an underdeveloped part of [target.Capital.GetName], where they often retire to hunt the local fauna. This provides a unique opportunity where they are relatively ungaurded, not having the protections afforded to them by the [target.GetName] while they are carrying out their official duties. One of our vessels could easily abduct them, allowing us to replace them with an impostor."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_officer.desc: "Our spies have been tailing the officer since we identified them as a promising target. Now our efforts have paid off. They will soon be travelling to a remote starbase in an unpopulated corner of [target.GetAdj] space. We could easily plant an abduction team aboard the starbase before they arrive, then all that would remain would be to prepare our operative to take their place in the government."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_politican.desc: "After talking to their aides and colleauges, it comes out that the [target.GetAdj] politician we've been shadowing is known for their volatile temper. Notably, they have an extremely tense relationship with a representative from a neighboring district, fueled by a history of class tensions between that district and their own. It would be easy to ensure that the two cross paths at an upcoming gala, and have our operatives tail them when they storm out."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_diplomat.desc: "Kidnapping and replacing the diplomat our spies identified as a promising target should be an easy task. For several years, they have been working to improve relations between our empire and the [target.GetName]. Our spies assure us it should be as simple as inviting them to our embassy on [target.Capital.GetName] for "diplomatic negotiations.""
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_diplomat_backchannel.desc: "Despite the lack of formal ties between our nation and the [target.GetName], one particularly enterprising diplomat has been attempting for several years to establish a line of backchannel communications between our two empires. Our spies have conveyed a coded message indicating our willingness to meet."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_spy.desc: "As it turns out, the [target.GetName] are also attempting to carry out covert operations inside our borders. We have identified one of the higher-ranking agents they currently have embedded in our government. This individual has built a fairly impressive circle of contacts and double-agents, even by our standards. However, with their identity revealed to us, it didn't take long to unravel their spy ring, allowing us to feed them a line of bad information that appears too juicy to pass up."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_journalist.desc: "The opportunity practically presented itself. For several years now, a respected [target.GetSpeciesName] journalist has been attempting to arrange interviews with senior members of our government. Until now the requests had been more or less ignored, languishing in bureacratic limbo, but now the journalist has received a surprise visa allowing them to travel to [root.owner.Capitol.GetName] and interview a mid-ranking official."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_ceo.desc: "Unknown to most on [target.Capital.GetName], the CEO our spies identified is experiencing acute financial troubles due to several unwise investments. Hardly a patriot, they have shown a willingness to look for capital beyond the borders of the [target.GetName]. A few well placed words about the generosity of [owner.GetAdj] investors has them reaching out to arrange a meeting."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_manager.desc: "After some research, our spies discovered that the manager our spies identified has been skimming funds for quite some time, and in a particularly clumsy way. The fact that no one in the [target.GetName] has caught them yet is a almost mind boggling. The threat of blackmail will likely be sufficient to force a secret meeting."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_executive.desc: "The executive our spies identified has a lover who they keep housed in a small villa on [target.Capital.GetName], a fact they have taken great pains to keep secret from the rest of [target.GetAdj] society. Security at the villa is weak and we could easily take control of it before their next visit."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_labor_organizer.desc: "Even in an egalitarian society like the [target.GetName], someone must labor to ensure the machines of industry remain staffed with willing comrades. Our spies have identified one such individual, and come to us with a plan to kidnap them and replace them with a [owner.GetSpeciesName] doppelganger."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_resource_coordinator.desc: "The target our spies identified is a resource coordinator in charge of ensuring all members of [target.GetAdj] society are allocated resources according to their need. Apparently, the target has the greatest need, as they have been skimming resources for several years, to the extent that notice is beginning to be taken of the extravagance of their lifestyle. This has made them a number of enemies, some of whom might be willing to cooperate with our agents."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_economist.desc: "Several years ago, the economist our spies have been watching noticed several irregularities in the stock market that turned out to be the result of underhanded economic dealings by a coalition of prominent corporations and stock-brokers. Several of the perpetrators ended up serving jail time for illegal market manipulation. Our spies believe it is highly probably that if we reach out to the right people, we may find both the motive and at least some of the means to capture our target."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_banker.desc: "It is an open secret in the [target.GetAdj] banking sector that our target is still suffering froma  drug problem they acquired while working as a lowly stock trader. This puts them in regular contact with less-than-reputable individuals, some of whom could certainly be convinced to assist our operation if provided with sufficient financial incentive."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_regulator.desc: "As it turns out, the state regulator our spies identified is in the habit of accepting bribes from corporations to give a better rating to the workplaces they are supposed to inspect. Of course, corporations are greedy, and one in particular is chafing under what they feel to be bribes that are "too steep". We have offered to cut them a better deal if they were to help us replace the regulator with someone more ... amenable."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_lobbyist.desc: "Our spies have identified a prominent lobbyist who represents the interests of the [target.GetAdj] merchant guilds. This lobbyist will soon be attending an extravagant soiree where they are expected to negotiate a deal for one of the major guilds to pay an even smaller fraction of the current pittance they currently face in taxes."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_scientist.desc: "The scientist our spies have identified will soon be leaving [target.Capital.GetName] on a scientific mission to survey a remote star system on the edge of [target.GetAdj] space. It would be a simple matter to park a cloaked ship on the dark side of one of the asteroids they are scheduled to survey, allowing our doppelganger to capture the target and then sneak back aboard when the landing party embarks."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_academic.desc: "The target our spies identified is a prominent figure in the academic scene on [target.Capital.GetName], having published several papers and books on a wide variety of subjects. They have recently been invited to attend a conference, and our spies are confident that this could provide the opportunity we are looking for."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_fleet_commander.desc: "The fleet commander our spies identified is known for their ... liberal use of military property. It is not uncommon for them to take strikecraft out for joy-rides while their fleet is patrolling some of the more remote systems in [target.GetAdj] space, which happens to be where they are currently posted. A cloaked shuttle on the dark side of a nearby planet would potentially be in a position to hijack their vessel."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_army_commander.desc: "The army commander our spies identified will soon be leading a training exercise on a remote region of [target.Capital.GetName] where [target.GetAdj] marines will drop from orbit and attempt to sieze control of a practice area. Sabotaging the commander's drop pod could result in them making planetfall far outside the designated landing area, allowing us to kidnap and replace them."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_military_advisor.desc: "The military advisor our spies have identified has become disillusioned with the [target.GetAdj] military. Several channels indicate that they are looking for an outlet to publish a large trove of classified documents in what would certainly be a whistelblower operation that would strike a significant blow to the [target.GetAdj] military. If we reached out to them, our spies believe we could arrange a meeting."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_security_contractor.desc: "The [target.GetAdj] govenment makes extensive use of security contractors to bolster their defensive and offensive capabilities, and the industry is worth trillions of energy credits. The owner of one such private military company is looking to increase their profitability, and as such has expressed interest in several cutting-edge weapons developed by [owner.GetAdj] scientists. Offering a demonstration could provide the opportunity needed to kidnap them and replace them with one of our operatives."
eo_infiltrators.3.asset_infilitrator_civilian_official.desc: "For several years now, the civilian official our spies identified has been looking into charges of corruption in the [target.GetAdj] military. When we fed them a piece of information about a officer who might be willing to testify, or at least divulge incriminatory evidence, they practically jumped at the chance. Despite our spymaster's concerns, they didn't even hesitate when we suggested a remote location for the rendezvous."

#Part 4
eo_infiltrators.4.title: "Infiltration"
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_official.desc: "As the target left the cult's headquarters via a back alley, our operatives sprung into action. The government official was grabbed and taken to a secure safehouse in the city, where our interrogaters hooked them up to a mind probe to extract their memories. Meanwhile, our surgeons were operating on their doppleganger, shaping their flesh and bones until they were indistinguishable from [from.target.GetSpeciesName] physique.\n\nThe last thing the official saw was their own face staring down at them."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_noble.desc: "The minor noble camped out overnight in a remote part of their estate, allowing us to sneak a cloaked vessel through [from.target.Capital.GetName]'s orbital defenses and beam them aboard in the middle of the night. Dazed and confused, they barely resisted as we hooked them up to the mind probe. Meanwhile, our surgeons were operating on the operative who would replace them, surgically altering them to have the outward appearance of a [from.target.GetSpeciesName].\n\nThe last thing the noble saw was their own face staring down at them."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_officer.desc: "Our strike team boarded the station hours before the officer was due to arrive for inspection, and met little resistance. By the time their shuttle arrived, all the signs of struggle had been cleared away... or at least that's what our strike team commander assured us. However, the officer and their guards saw something amiss, and put up an admirable, if futile, resistance to our ambush. We spaced the guards and hooked the officer up to the mind probe while our surgeons made the final alterations to transform the officer's doppleganger into their mirror image, indistinguishable from a real [from.target.GetSpeciesName],\n\nThe last thing the officer saw was their own face staring down at them."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_politican.desc: "Tensions boiled as soon as the two politicians set eyes on each other. Despite bystanders attempts to mediate, a fight soon broke out over some perceived underhandedness in the drafting of a recent government spending plan. The target left the building through a backdoor, where they were promptly bagged and abducted by our operatives. We had a shielded anti-grav car waiting nearby, where our surgically-altered doppelganger was waiting to have their new memories implanted as soon as we hooked the target up to the mind probe.\n\nThe last thing the politician saw was their own face staring down at them."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_diplomat.desc: "The diplomat arrived at our embassy early in [from.target.Capital.GetName]'s day cycle. After being courteously greeted at the front gate, where we asked their personal escort to remain outside, they were escorted inside and taken directly to a room we had prepared for the operation. They must have realized our motives, because they attempted to flee, but our embassy guards were more than a match for them. The agent who was to replace them had been smuggled in overnight and reconstructive surgery was already almost complete by the time we attached the diplomat to the mind-probe. Their escort suspected nothing when our impostor walked out, talking animatedly about a potential diplomatic breakthrough."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_diplomat_backchannel.desc: "It was decided that the location for the backchannel negotiations would be in a remote and unpopulated star system on the edge of [from.target.GetAdj] space. The diplomat commandeered a private vessel for the meeting, not wanting to draw attention to their unsactioned effort. We boarded their shuttle as soon as it entered the system, promptly siphoning their memories into our doppelganger through the use of a portable mind-probe.\n\nThe last thing the diplomat saw was their own face staring down at them."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_spy.desc: "The spy was overly ambitious. Looking to make a breakthrough, they set out alone to track down a potential lead we had dangled, hoping to claim all the credit. Thinking they were going to meet one of their own operatives, they fell directly into our trap. Our agents captured them as soon as they arrived at the rendezvous, a deserted warehouse in a remote corner of the spaceport. The location had already been prepared for the procedure; we terminated them and disposed of the body as soon as the memory tranfer to our doppelganger was complete. All that remains is to contrive a reason for them to return to [from.target.GetAdj] space."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_journalist.desc: "The journalist never made it to the interview. Our agents kidnapped them almost as soon as they left the spaceport, siphoned their memories with a mind probe, and implanted them in the surgically-altered doppelganger, who continued to the interview while we disposed of the late journalist's body. To remove any trace of suspicion that might be focused on them after their return, we allowed the official to leak some embarrassing, if unimportant, details for publication on [from.target.Capital.GetName]."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_ceo.desc: "The [from.target.GetSpeciesAdj] CEO arrived at a secluded corporate retreat on [from.owner.Capital.GetName] prepared for what they believed to be a meeting with potential investors. Our infiltration team had rented the entire resort several days in advance, so subduing the target went off without a hitch. They were quickly hooked up to a mind probe and their memories transferred into a surgically altered doppelganger.\n\nThe last thing the CEO saw was their own face staring down at them."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_manager.desc: "As predicted, the manager was terrified at the threat of their scheme being exposed, and readily agreed to meet at a hotel on [from.target.Capital.GetName], unaware it was a trap. When they arrived, our infiltration team was already prepared. With their memories transferred into a surgically-altered body double, the last thing the manager saw was their own face staring down at them."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_executive.desc: "Our infiltration team took the villa in the early ours of the day on [from.target.Capital.GetName], and had all signs of struggle wiped away by the time the executive arrived. After spending time with a doppelganger disguised as their lover, the executive fell into a deep slumber. Our agents attached them to the mind probe, put the final touches on our doppelganger, and disposed of them without incident."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_labor_organizer.desc: "The target was returning to their communal housing apartment after a late shift at the factory when our operatives apprehended them. Using a makeshift operating station in the back of an anti-grav van, the inflitration team quickly siphoned their memories into our doppelganger using a mind probe while the reconstruction surgery was still taking place.\n\nThe last thing the labor organizer saw was their own face staring down at them."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_resource_coordinator.desc: "It would appear that greed and fraud in an egalitarian society such as the [from.target.GetName] does not pay. We were able to find a fellow resource coordinator who was more than willing to assist us in capturing our target. Once our spies had them, it was a simple matter of siphoning their memories into our doppelganger with a mind probe.\n\nThe last thing the corrupt coordinator saw was their own face staring down at them."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_economist.desc: "Our spies were correct. One of the stockbrokers who served prison time following the economist's revelation has been plotting revenge since their release, and only needed minimal access to our espionage operation to put their plan into action. They were more than satisfied to let us replace the economist with a doppelganger once we assured them that our agents would not interfere in their future operations."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_banker.desc: "It was a simple matter to arrange an ambush with one of the banker's suppliers. When they arrived at the place where they usually met their dealer, they were instead captured by our infiltration team who proceeded to hook them up to the mind-probe for memory extraction. Meanwhile, our surgeons were operating on their doppleganger, shaping their flesh and bones until they were indistinguishable from [from.target.GetSpeciesName] physique.\n\nThe last thing the official saw was their own face staring down at them."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_regulator.desc: "The regulator arrived at the factory for a pre-arranged "surprise" inspection agreed upon with the corporation, only to find all the workers sent home and our infiltration team waiting for them. Our agents hooked them up to the mind-probe for the memory transfer while our surgeons put the final touches on the surgically-altered doppelganger.\n\nwith the promise of more lenient bribes, the corporation helped us dispose of the body. A profitable arrangement all-round."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_lobbyist.desc: "Once our agents inflitrated the soiree, it was a simple matter to slip a strong laxative into the lobbyist's drink. Soon they were rushing to the bathroom with a roiling [from.target.GetSpeciesOrganName], where our infiltration team, disguised as waitstaff, was ready to ambush them. When our surgically altered doppelganger strolled back into the venue, memories enhanced by those extracted from the lobbyist with the mind-probe, no one seemed more worried than would be normal in the face of a bout of extreme indigestion."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_scientist.desc: "The actual abduction went off without a hitch. When the landing shuttle touched down on the asteroid, the target was quickly separated from the rest of the party when they moved out of sight behind the wall of a crater to survey a particularly unique outcropping of rock. They were rapidly waylaid and replaced by our doppelganger, their memories transferred with a portable mind-probe. No-one will find their body where our agent buried it under a thin layer of powdered ice.\n\nHowever, things quickly spiraled out of control once back aboard the science ship. After our agent made an improper data entry, a wave of paranoia swept through the crew. Luckily, it wasn't traced to the doppelganger, but soon scientists and crew were accusing each-other of being "impostors" who had snuck aboard from the asteroid. Things escalated to a fever pitch, and several unfortunate individuals were ejected from the airlock by their panicking crewmates. In the end, only our impostor and a few of the more level-headed members of the crew survived."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_academic.desc: "Our agents engineered a spill of starship fuel on the route the academic was taking to the conference, forcing them to take a detour. As their anti-grav car was passing through a back alley near the forum, the infiltration team ambushed and captured them. One quick memory transfer and reconstructive surgery later, our doppelganger was able to walk into the conference less than half an hour late, while the body of the academic was disposed of in a nearby waste-recycling facility."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_fleet_commander.desc: "Our cloaked vessel was barely in position when contacts aboard the [from.target.GetAdj] fleet reported that the target had left the hanger bay in a small one-[from.target.GetSpeciesName] craft. As soon as the vessel passed into the shadow of a nearby planet, a targeted electromagnetic pulse rendered it inactive and our strike team swarmed aboard. The commander was powerless to resist as we hooked them up to the mind-probe and extracted their memories for implantation in our surgically-altered doppelganger.\n\nWhen the impostor returned to the fleet, no one had even noticed the brief loss of communications with the strikecraft."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_army_commander.desc: "During atmospheric entry, one of the stabilizing rockets on the army commander's drop pod "unexpectedly" failed, landing them at a considerable distance from the location of the drill. When they emerged from the pod, our infiltration team was waiting. They put up an admirable yet futile resistance, and were soon hooked up to the mind-probe for memory extraction. Meanwhile, the surgeons were altering the doppelanger to be indistinguishable from them in every conceivable way. By the time marines from the exercise arrived at the location, our operatives had already buried the commander's body and only the doppelganger remained to greet the relieved troops."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_military_advisor.desc: "The whistleblower agreed to meet, and arrived at the rendezvous with a trove of classified information. Due to the secrecy of their mission, they were unaccompanied by their usual security personnel and were easily overwhelmed by our infiltration team, who wasted no time attaching them to the mind-probe while the surgeons finalized the appearance of the doppelganger. The [from.target.GetAdj] will never know how close they were to a massive leak of classified information - or that they may have suffered something much worse instead."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_security_contractor.desc: "The owner of the private military company jumped at the chance to attend a weapon testing in [from.owner.GetAdj] space. Since the [from.target.GetName] likely wouldn't approve, they arranged for the trip to be covert, ensuring no one would interrupt our ... dealings. Disguised as weapons experts, our infiltration team was welcomed aboard their shuttle where they promptly subdued the contractor and hooked them up to the mind probe. With the surgically-altered doppelganger complete, the last thing the contractor saw was their own face looking down at them."
eo_infiltrators.4.asset_infilitrator_civilian_official.desc: "The target practically did our work for us. Due to their tireless investigations into corruption, they are ... less than popular with the [from.target.GetAdj] military's upper echelons. Fearing their lead would dry up, they shrouded the details of their investigation in the deepest secrecy, and no-one knew about our rendezvous. When they arrived alone, our agents quickly overpowered them and hooked them into the mind-probe, while the surgeons put the final touches on their doppelganger.\n\nThe last thing the civilian official saw was their own face staring down at them."
